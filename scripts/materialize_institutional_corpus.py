Zhang, Zohren, Roberts (synthetic brief for retrieval benchmarking)
2021

Abstract
We study convolutional and attention architectures over normalized L2 order book tensors for predicting mid-price changes at the next tick, emphasizing leakage-safe splits by trading session and instrument.

Methodology
Architectures include deep CNNs over multi-level bid/ask stacks, dilated temporal convolutions, and Transformer encoders with relative time embeddings. Training uses cross-entropy and Huber losses on directional labels derived from future mid quotes.

Datasets
Experiments use FI-2010 and proprietary LOB snapshots anonymized to five price levels; evaluation reports accuracy, F1, and Matthews correlation on stratified time splits.

Results
Attention models modestly outperform CNNs when depth exceeds eight levels; calibration via temperature scaling improves probability quality for downstream risk limits.

NMT Note (synthetic)
2023

Abstract
We generate synthetic parallel data from monolingual target text using a multilingual instruction-tuned model and filter pairs with round-trip consistency.

Methodology
Quality estimation with COMET-style scores; vocabulary overlap filters.

Datasets
Low-resource pairs from WMT tiny tracks.

Results
BLEU gains of several points over pivot translation; hallucinated entities remain a risk for domain-specific monolingual text.

Document AI Brief (synthetic)
2022

Abstract
We detect text blocks, tables, and checkboxes on scanned government forms with a DETR-style detector and resolve reading order with a lightweight solver.

Methodology
Synthetic distortions for augmentation; bipartite matching loss at train time.

Datasets
Thousands of form images with polygon annotations under license.

Results
mAP improves over classical layout pipelines on skewed scans; handwritten fields remain out of distribution.

Risk Modeling Note (synthetic)
2018

Abstract
We apply temperature scaling and Platt scaling on out-of-fold predictions from gradient boosted trees for PD models subject to monotonicity constraints.

Methodology
Isotonic regression where constraints allow; Brier score and reliability diagrams for monitoring.

Datasets
Retail mortgage vintages with multi-year outcomes.

Results
Expected calibration error drops materially on the test horizon; recalibration needed after macro shocks even when AUC is stable.

Active Learning Brief (synthetic)
2019

Abstract
We select labeling batches using uncertainty scores tempered with k-means++ diversity in embedding space to avoid redundant images.

Methodology
Core-set approximations compared to BADGE embeddings from penultimate layer features.

Datasets
CIFAR-100 and internal defect inspection imagery.

Results
Label budget to reach target accuracy drops twenty to thirty percent versus naive uncertainty sampling; batch size interacts strongly with diversity gains.
